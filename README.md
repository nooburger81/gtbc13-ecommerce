  ## Description
  I believe the concept for this challenge was to utilize ORM (object relational mapping) to create a database for an online shopping experience. That's what I got out of it...

  ## Installation
  Open the folder in your favorite code editor. Run npm install. Seed the database by entering 'node seeds/index.js' on your command line of the terminal. Run the server by entering 'node server.js.' When connected, utilize Insomniac or Postman to view and make changes to database content.

  ## Usage
  I'm not sure...
